# Advanced_Dijkstra_Algorithm
Dijkstra Algorithm --- Finding the most optimal path on the map.  
I'd like to call it "advanced" because I also added transportation and width limits, which make it more vivid.

To begin with, we have to covert the .txt into Numpy matrix, so the map looks like that.

When I was young, I was fascinated with Google Map thought it was a black magic..  
I still remembered that I gained a plenty of accomplishment from it.  
I feel like i'm a senior software engineer in google map team.
